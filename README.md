# Muse-Focus
A web app that helps students and workers track calmness and focus using Muse. 

Muse-Focus is a web app that helps students and working professionals improve their focus and calmness using the Muse headband. It turns quiet focus time into something you can track and build as a daily habit.

# Why this product matters
Today, many students and workers struggle with distractions, stress, and difficulty staying focused for long periods. We track steps, sleep, and workouts, but there’s no simple way to track our mental calmness and focus levels.  
Muse-Focus bridges that gap by using real brain-signal feedback to help users measurably build calm focus habits.

## Who it’s for
- Students preparing for exams or studying  
- Remote workers and office professionals  
- Anyone trying to build focus and reduce stress  

### What the product does
- Connects to the Muse wearable device  
- Tracks calmness and focus in real time  
- Gives you a daily “Focus Score”  
- Shows your progress with simple charts  
- Encourages streaks and short, calm sessions during the day  

## Key Features
- Focus Score (daily calmness measurement)  
- Session timer + guided focus break reminders  
- Weekly focus trends  
- Streak tracker + badges  
- Simple reflection log (how you felt after each session)  

## Tech Overview (Simple View)
- Frontend: React (web app)  
- Backend: Node.js API  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Muse Integration: Muse SDK / Bluetooth data connection  
- Hosting: Vercel or Render  

# Why this approach works
Muse already measures brain activity, so we are not inventing new hardware. We are building a simple interface that helps users turn quiet focus time into a daily habit they can measure and improve.  
Muse-Focus keeps the design simple and removes noise. The goal is to help users be present, calm, and focused, not overwhelm them with options.

## Next Steps (internal plan)
- Build prototype UI  
- Connect Muse SDK  
- Test focus score tracking  
- Release the MVP to a small group of students and workers
